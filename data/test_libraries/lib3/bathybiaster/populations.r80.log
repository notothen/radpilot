Population-level summary statistics will be written to 'stacks.M5/populations.r80/populations.sumstats.tsv'
Population-level haplotype summary statistics will be written to 'stacks.M5/populations.r80/populations.hapstats.tsv'

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)

Batch 1 

Removed 345080 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 353555 loci.
Kept 8475 loci, composed of 1001997 sites; 7815 of those sites were filtered, 33005 variant sites remained.
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 118.23bp (stderr 0.03).

Population summary statistics (more detail in populations.sumstats_summary.tsv):
  defaultpop: 10.014 samples per locus; pi: 0.22469; all/variant/polymorphic sites: 1001996/33005/33005; private alleles: 0
Populations is done.
