Population-level summary statistics will be written to 'stacks.M5/populations.r80/populations.sumstats.tsv'
Population-level haplotype summary statistics will be written to 'stacks.M5/populations.r80/populations.hapstats.tsv'

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)

Batch 2 
Batch 3 

Removed 618805 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 645893 loci.
Kept 27088 loci, composed of 3205284 sites; 13704 of those sites were filtered, 144739 variant sites remained.
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 118.33bp (stderr 0.02).

Population summary statistics (more detail in populations.sumstats_summary.tsv):
  defaultpop: 14.35 samples per locus; pi: 0.2036; all/variant/polymorphic sites: 3205242/144739/144739; private alleles: 0
Populations is done.
