Genotyping markers will be written to 'stacks.M6/populations.r50/populations.markers.tsv'
Raw Genotypes/Haplotypes will be written to 'stacks.M6/populations.r50/populations.haplotypes.tsv'
Population-level summary statistics will be written to 'stacks.M6/populations.r50/populations.sumstats.tsv'
Population-level haplotype summary statistics will be written to 'stacks.M6/populations.r50/populations.hapstats.tsv'

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)

Batch 1 

Removed 540353 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 542591 loci.
Kept 2238 loci, composed of 266618 sites; 1786 of those sites were filtered, 7910 variant sites remained.
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 119.13bp (stderr 0.09).

Population summary statistics (more detail in populations.sumstats_summary.tsv):
  defaultpop: 5.3324 samples per locus; pi: 0.3683; all/variant/polymorphic sites: 266618/7910/7910; private alleles: 0
Populations is done.
