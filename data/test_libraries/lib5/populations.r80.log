Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)

Removed 253229 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 317109 loci.
Kept 63880 loci, composed of 7517008 sites; 16148 of those sites were filtered, 20538 variant sites remained.
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 117.67bp (stderr 0.01).

Population summary statistics (more detail in populations.sumstats_summary.tsv):
  defaultpop: 7.5244 samples per locus; pi: 0.50157; all/variant/polymorphic sites: 7516997/20538/20538; private alleles: 0
Populations is done.
