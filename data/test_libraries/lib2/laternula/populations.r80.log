Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)

Removed 358606 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 413456 loci.
Kept 54850 loci, composed of 6451542 sites; 15202 of those sites were filtered, 71372 variant sites remained.
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 117.62bp (stderr 0.01).

Population summary statistics (more detail in populations.sumstats_summary.tsv):
  defaultpop: 9.1136 samples per locus; pi: 0.34574; all/variant/polymorphic sites: 6451495/71372/71372; private alleles: 0
Populations is done.
