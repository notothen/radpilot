Population-level summary statistics will be written to 'stacks.M4/populations.r80/populations.sumstats.tsv'
Population-level haplotype summary statistics will be written to 'stacks.M4/populations.r80/populations.hapstats.tsv'

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)

Removed 471579 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 523955 loci.
Kept 52376 loci, composed of 6158528 sites; 16123 of those sites were filtered, 49776 variant sites remained.
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 117.58bp (stderr 0.01).

Population summary statistics (more detail in populations.sumstats_summary.tsv):
  defaultpop: 11.257 samples per locus; pi: 0.30408; all/variant/polymorphic sites: 6158443/49776/49776; private alleles: 0
Populations is done.
