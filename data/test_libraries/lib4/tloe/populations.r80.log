Population-level haplotype summary statistics will be written to 'stacks.M3/populations.r80/populations.hapstats.tsv'

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)

Batch 1 
Batch 2 

Removed 34723 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 49400 loci.
Kept 14677 loci, composed of 3783454 sites; 11107 of those sites were filtered, 40929 variant sites remained.
Number of loci with PE contig: 14677.00 (100.0%);
  Mean length of loci: 247.78bp (stderr 0.13);
Number of loci with SE/PE overlap: 8249.00 (56.2%);
  Mean length of overlapping loci: 255.08bp (stderr 0.15); mean overlap: 25.76bp (stderr 0.07);
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 253.40bp (stderr 0.13).

Population summary statistics (more detail in populations.sumstats_summary.tsv):
  defaultpop: 11.546 samples per locus; pi: 0.23085; all/variant/polymorphic sites: 3719155/40929/40929; private alleles: 0
