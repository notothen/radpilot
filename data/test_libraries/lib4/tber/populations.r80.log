Population-level haplotype summary statistics will be written to 'stacks.M3/populations.r80/populations.hapstats.tsv'

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)

Batch 2 

Removed 26911 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 40631 loci.
Kept 13720 loci, composed of 3547300 sites; 8841 of those sites were filtered, 26635 variant sites remained.
Number of loci with PE contig: 13720.00 (100.0%);
  Mean length of loci: 248.55bp (stderr 0.13);
Number of loci with SE/PE overlap: 7326.00 (53.4%);
  Mean length of overlapping loci: 255.87bp (stderr 0.13); mean overlap: 24.84bp (stderr 0.07);
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 253.90bp (stderr 0.12).

Population summary statistics (more detail in populations.sumstats_summary.tsv):
  defaultpop: 11.557 samples per locus; pi: 0.26428; all/variant/polymorphic sites: 3483537/26635/26635; private alleles: 0
